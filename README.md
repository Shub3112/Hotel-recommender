Hotel Recommendation System Based on Customer Feedback Using Machine Learning

This project is a Hotel Recommendation System designed to help users find the best hotels based on their personal preferences and past customer feedback. Using a content-based recommendation approach, the system analyzes detailed aspects of hotel reviews, such as amenities, location, service quality, and overall customer satisfaction, to provide personalized hotel recommendations.

Content-Based Filtering: The recommendation engine evaluates the features and feedback of hotels that a user has liked in the past and recommends new hotels that share similar characteristics. This ensures that the suggestions are tailored to the userâ€™s specific tastes and requirements.

Customer Feedback Analysis: The system delves into customer reviews, extracting valuable insights about various hotel features. These insights are used to match hotels with user preferences effectively.

Interactive User Interface: The application is deployed on Streamlit, offering an intuitive and interactive platform where users can input their preferences (e.g., location, amenities) and receive hotel recommendations instantly.

Real-Time Recommendations: As users adjust their preferences, the system updates the recommendations in real time, providing an engaging and dynamic user experience.

Technical Overview:
Machine Learning Algorithms: The recommendation engine is powered by advanced machine learning techniques that process customer feedback and hotel features to generate accurate recommendations.

Streamlit Deployment: The entire application is built and deployed using Streamlit, making it accessible and easy to use directly from your web browser.
This project is ideal for travelers seeking personalized hotel suggestions based on past experiences and specific preferences. Whether you're planning a vacation or a business trip, this recommendation system will help you find the perfect hotel.
